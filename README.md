# 💖 puuung-live

**puuung-live** is a tribute project inspired by the beautiful animated shorts created by **Puuung**, a South Korean artist known for heartwarming animations centered around love, friendship, and everyday moments.

Puuung once hosted a 24/7 live stream on their official YouTube channel that looped these animations with calming background music. Unfortunately, the stream was eventually taken down. After years of hoping it would return, I decided to recreate the experience for fans to enjoy again.

## 🎥 How It Works

* The project uses the **YouTube IFrame Player API** to play a curated list of Puuung’s publicly available videos.
* An algorithm determines which video to play and at what timestamp, based on the current time — effectively simulating a continuous "live" stream.
* The approach is entirely **serverless** and implemented with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## 🤍 A Small Tribute

This project was built out of appreciation for Puuung’s work and as a way for fans to revisit the comforting atmosphere of the original stream.
I hope you enjoy the experience as much as I did building it.
